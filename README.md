Name: Grace Johnson-Safeguarding 

 https://gracey46.github.io/Safeguarding/

Description: 

This project shows some important information on safeguarding.  

It looks at What is safeguarding, What signs people can look for, Actions people can take and some helpful links to other websites.  

This page is the home page and the minimal viable product. It can be expanded and built on at later dates.  

It has a contact page so users can communicate/ get in contact. 

 

Features: 

The project is build-up of 4 main sections: header, hero, main and footer.  

Header 

The header section has a navigation bar that displays the word home. The home works as a button and works to return to this first page.  

On a small screen you will then see a drop-down subject selection. This is to make it easier to find information on the page instead of having to scroll through it all. 

Hero 

The hero section displays and image of clay people standing together with a slogan expressing the key principle of safeguarding. 

Main 

There are 5 information cards in the main area which display a question then information under neath. Some are in unorder lists some in just a paragraph. 

The links area and get in contact all have working and tested links that are highlighted by being underlined and a different colour.  

The contact card is working and will send the user to a contact page where there is a form to fill out with email and comment.  

The form is a clear simple layout which sits in a box onto of a photo of paper people in a circle of hands. 

Footer 

The footer displays the copyright and links to Facebook and twitter. The href links are there ready to fill but are not linked to anything as of yet. 

 

UX/UI 

This site is a minimally yet effective site to allow someone to access information on safeguarding. It defines what safeguarding is, what signs of abuse or neglect they could look for, actions they can take, useful information they can access to gather more information and a place to get in contact if there are further enquiries. 

This site is clearly laid out with 5 cards on information. The colour red was used as a colour theme because it is a colour usually associated with danger and because this site is talking about protecting people who may be in danger or harm's way the colour theme fits appropriately.

All CSS has been copied and tested at: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ 

No bug or problems were highlighted 

 
Deployment 

This site was deployed to GitHub pages. The way of deployment are as follows: 

Go to your GitHub repository then go to settings. 

Once on settings on the left hand of the page scroll to pages under the code and automation section  

Once you have clicked on pages. On the main screen under branches, you will see a drop down. Cange it from None to Main. 

You will then notice next to it the drop-down options are /(root) or /docs. 

Make sure you have selected /(root) then click save.

Bootstrap was used to make the grid system and design for the information cards 

Bookstrap was used to make the contact form.

Feature left to implement. 

In future releases it would be more insightful to have more information, and the information have a read more button that takes you to a page with more detailed information for that section instead of having such concise bits of information this is due to the length of time had for this project.  

The send button on the contact form to send the information that is filled out to be sent to someone this is due to not having a location for the messages to be sent.  

There to be pages in twitter and Facebook for them to be linked to and fully work this is due to not having those social media pages. 


Summary 

In conclusion this is a minimal viable product to inform people on the basics of safeguarding. It is simply and effectively displayed for all devices. The navigation bar may be beneficial if it would be added to a medium screen as well as a small screen.  

The design did differ from the wireframe in some areas: 1st area is the contact button not being in the footer. I did not feel this was the correct place for it to sit. 2nd The contact form was its own standing page and not a pop out that's due to the timeframe and that making a new page that is linked was less time consuming. 

All links and pages work although when clicking on a link to an external page it would be nice if they opened in a new tab keeping the website open for easy access to return to the original page. 

All code has been checked tested, and no bugs are currently displaying themselves.  

Throughout this project AI was used to aid code and concise information. This was a helpful resource leading concise information and time saved on parts of code.  

Using AI is a helpful tool however it was not used extensively in this project.
